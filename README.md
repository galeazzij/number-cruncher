# number-cruncher
This is my repository for a number crunching program that I'm working on.

I'm mainly using this program to test my coding skill but would also like to possibly utilize it in some future programs.

Currnently it can only calculate factorials, tell whether an number is odd or even, and calculate the multiples of a number.
